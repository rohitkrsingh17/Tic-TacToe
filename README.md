# Tic Tac Toe Game using 2D Array

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using a 2D array in a programming language of your choice.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In this implementation, we use a 2D array to represent the game board. Each element of the array corresponds to a cell on the board.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Players take turns to make their moves by entering the row and column numbers where they want to place their mark.
3. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (a draw).
4. The program will then announce the result.
